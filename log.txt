I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors 
(AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional 
Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, 
including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

Total number of instructional faculty

Full-time instructional faculty:  faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time 
for research)
Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. 
Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month 
sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical 
credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska 
Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic. 
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and 
Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public 
administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS or 
DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric 
medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

Terminal degree:  the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).

(a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid 
(e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, 
post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows

(g) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay

(d) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but 
have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like

(e) faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay
(f) faculty on leave without pay 

Total number with doctorate, or other terminal degree

Total number whose highest degree is a master's but not a terminal 
master's
Total number whose highest degree is a bachelor's
Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other  (Note:  
Items f, g, h, and i must sum up to item a.)
Total number in stand-alone graduate/ professional programs in 
which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students

Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2016. Include 
faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for 
IPEDS/AAUP.

Student to Faculty Ratio

Total number who are nonresident aliens (international)

Total number who are members of minority groups
Total number who are women
Total number who are men

(b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach,

Class Sections:  A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and 
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a 
laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at 
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes 
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, 
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section 
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

CLASS 
SECTIONS

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class 
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2016. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who 
met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in 
the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table. 

Class Subsections:  A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, 
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet 
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any 
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, 
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music 
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be 
duplicated because of cross-listings.

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and 
class sections offered in the Fall 2016 term.

CLASS SUB-
SECTIONS

Report the Fall 2016 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent 
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students 
in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, 
business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students. Do not count 
undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

J. DEGREES CONFERRED

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees 
awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be 
represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd 
majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major 
as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

Financial Aid Definitions

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that 
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork 
to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid 
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA. 
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, 
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student 
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for 
which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own 
standards. 
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other 
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and 
noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other 
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs  from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a 
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from 
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) 
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When 
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid. 
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work
Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student 
need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender 
used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your 
institution in financial aid awards.
